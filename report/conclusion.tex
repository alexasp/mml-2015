\section{Future Work}

Further develop and test the propagation of aggregated models. We experienced that when we shared the aggregated models globally in our network, we could decrease the SD in our classification error, as well as sometimes improving the classifier. Further research should go in expanding this behavior, as you could potentially propagate models only to peers in geographic and/or demographic vicinity. This could possibly lead to more specialized models, which could give better classification rate to a specialized subset of peers.
