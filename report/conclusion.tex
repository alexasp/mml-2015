\section{Future Work}

Further develop and test the propagation of aggregated models. We experienced that when we shared the aggregated models globally in our network, we could decrease the SD in our classification error, as well as sometimes improving the classifier. Further research should go in expanding this behavior, as you could potentially propagate models only to peers in geographic and/or demographic vicinity. This could possibly lead to more specialized models, which could give better classification rate to a specialized subset of peers.  

Implement the Newscast algorithm for selecting peers. The Newscast algorithm is a gossip protocol which facilitates a robust spread of information. The core of the protocol involves periodic and pairvise interaction between processes. Implementing this algorithm would allow our system to scale better when a big number of peers are added to the network. The biggest bottleneck of our system at the moment is the peer sampling during the group forming, as it requires a single agent to act as a manager for how groups are formed. The basic idea of the Newscast algorithm is that each node, or peer in our situation, has a partial view of the system. All nodes exchange their views periodically, which allows them to keep an up-to-date view locally and spread their information throughout the network. Further research into this algorithm would allow us to customize this algorithm so that peers in our network could form groups based on their partial views of the network.
