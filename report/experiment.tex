\chapter{Experiment}

Introduce the experiment

\subsection{Dataset}
This section will introduce the dataset(s) used. What features it contains, what we try to learn/classify, and why we chose to use it.

\section{Algorithm}
This section explain the logistic regression algorithm, how it is commonly used, and what modifications are needed when used in a distributed setting. Explanation on how it is used in a differentially private manner is explained in the architecture section. 


\subsection{Distribution}
Introduce notion of distributed machine learning. 

Why did we choose to perform distributed learning?

How does it fit with the notion of differential privacy?

Can we guarantee differential privacy while doing it distributed

Record-based differential privacy. Does it work?

\todo[inline]{This section should maybe go somewhere else, but where?}

\section{Architecture}

In this section we will describe the architecture of Archipelago, our distributed machine learning system. 
Using notions borrowed from PINQ, we designed a distributed system using the JADE framework. Consists of explanation of peers, NoisyQueryable, DataLoader

\subsection{Communication}
\subsubsection{Peer}
How is each peer set up, and what behaviours do they implement? 
How do they update then propagate the model being learned.
How do they know when to stop?
\subsubsection{messaging}
How do the peers communicate with each other?
What does a message look like?
What is the PeerGraph?
What controls the messages and determines where they should go?

\subsection{Learning}
How is a logistic model implemented in our framework?
How is a model created and passed around the network?
How does the ensemble learning choose the best model?
What kind of performance metrics are used?

\subsection{Privacy}
How does our framework guarantee differential privacy?
What concepts have been borrowed from PINQ?
What is NoisyQueryable?

\subsection{Experiment}
How are the experiments set up?
Explain the testing scheme.
