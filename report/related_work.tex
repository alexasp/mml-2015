Boutet et al. worked on a privacy-preserving distributed collaborative filtering which relied on user profile obfuscation and randomized response.\cite{boutet2013DisCollFil}.

Boutsis et al developed a participatory sensing system for smartphones which assumed that the data was distributed locally. Their system was called LOCATE, which handled ensured the privacy of the users, but they did not provide a differential privacy guarantee. \cite{boutsis2013}

Chaudhuri and Monteloni designed a logistic regression algorithm which guaranteed differential privacy in 2009, but their algorithm was designed to run on a single centralized database\cite{chaudhuri2009logistic}.

Han et al. investigated the problem of preserving differential privacy in distributed constrained optimization. By creating an algorithm based on stochastic gradient descent, which preserved privacy by adding noise to the public coordination signals (i.e gradients). \cite{han2014disOptimization}

Ji et al. \cite{ji2014DisLogReg} recently proposed a distributed solution using logistic regression, which learned from both private and publicly available medical datasets. Their solution differ from our own as they employ a globally synchronized structure, whereas our own solution works asynchronously. Their approach also requires a global aggregation of gradients, compared to our own which employ distributed ensemble learning,
